The FPROPxxxx.DAT files were done by Martin Marietta Corporation and
the FLUIDxxxx.DAT files were created by John Keller of Lockheed
Engineering and Sciences Company.  

The F6717.INC and F6717.ENG were written by MMC for use in version 2.5.
They are accurate within a certain range, and are advertised to be 60%
faster than the library fluids.

The F****_PT.INC were also written by MMC for version 2.5.  They are
correct for a wider range of fluids and are advertised to be 50% faster
than library solutions.  Some of the fluids defined here, O2, H2, and others
do not have library descriptions. These routines have pressure and 
temperature depentdent properties which are very accurate around the 
critical point.  These routines have much more data, abd therefore the
compilation stage of the run is longer than usual.

Of course, no one takes responsibility for the correctness of the files.
Keep in mind that they are tabular data and not full equations.  Some error
will exist.

Use at your own risks.
